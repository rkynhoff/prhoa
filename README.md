Plum Run HOA website project for <code>Louisville.

I'm building a basic website for my neighborhood's homeowners' association. 
The purpose of the site is for residents to access the following:
  1. Current Board Members
  2. Neighboordhood Covenants and Restrictions
  3. Announcements 
  4. Important Dates
  5. Board Contact Information
  6. City/County Utility Info
  7. City/County Municipal Info
  8. Nextdoor.com
